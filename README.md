### 🔍 Key Visualizations:

1. **📈 Most Reported Side Effects**

   * Identified the top 10 side effects across thousands of records.
   * Helped reveal symptom clusters impacting patient experience.

2. **📊 Drug Class vs Medical Conditions**

   * Bar plots showed how frequently drug classes like *Topical Steroids* or *Acne Agents* are used across conditions such as eczema, acne, etc.
   * Insights assist in treatment pattern understanding.

3. **📦 Rating Distribution by Drug Class**

   * Boxplots captured rating variations across medication classes.
   * Useful for aligning patient satisfaction with treatment types.

4. **🌐 Word Cloud of Side Effects**

   * Created a word cloud showing high-frequency terms across all side effect descriptions.
   * A quick glance helps identify focus areas for medical review.

5. **🧊 Heatmap of Side Effect Correlations**

   * Explored how side effects like *Itching*, *Hives*, and *Breathing Difficulties* co-occur.
   * Highlighted safety concerns and clusters for pharmacovigilance.

6. **📊 Stacked Bar for Drug Classes & Side Effects**

   * Visualized which drug classes are associated with specific side effects.
   * Great for comparative risk analysis.

7. **🧩 Treemap of Top Drug Classes**

   * A hierarchical breakdown of drug class frequency.
   * Quick view of market dominance and therapeutic focus.
